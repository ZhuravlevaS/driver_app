# Driver App

## 🚗 Driver App Requirements

1. Check for a shift

- On app load, simulate a logged-in driver (driverId=123)
- Call the API to check if there’s an assigned shift

2. Vehicle Check

- A simple checklist defined by the NodeJS service
- All items must be marked “OK” before continuing
- Submit the checklist via API

<u>Important:</u> a ride is being assigned to the driver between **5–20 seconds** after the successful vehicle check

3. Passenger Check-in

- Allow driver to check them in one by one

4. Start Ride (only if all passengers are handled)

## 🧪 Sample Driver
